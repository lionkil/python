    "\n",
    "This is actually not a big problem for us. My plan is to deliver lectures remotely, via Panopto webinars, and for our practical sessions to also take place remotely, via collaboration in MS Teams. Note that the latter allows for group meetings, text chats, 1-on-1 video calls, screen sharing, file sharing, and even for allowing others to control your desktop (meaning that we can physically interact with your code on your screen to help you debug things, for example). \n",
    "\n",

However, please don't panic if you have no idea how to tackle this yet. We haven't got to the point in our data analysis lessons where we actually do this type of modelling -- all of this will make sense, I promise. For the moment, it would be good to get on top of the (astro-)physics and notation, which isn't hard, but may look confusing initially. I.e. just make sure you understand what we are asking you to do in each of the steps, and also overall.**"

    "### Step 1: The Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "The file \"MW_Cepheids.dat\" contains data for a sample of 10 Cepheid stars in the Milky Way. The table contains 7 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The name of the star\n",
    "2. its *parallax* in milli-arcsecond (see below)\n",
    "3. the error on the parallax\n",
    "4. its pulsation period in days\n",
    "5. its visual magnitude (see below)\n",
    "7. the extinction towards the star in magnitudes (see below) \n",
    "8. the error on the extinction in magnitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Magnitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "The brightness of astronomical objects is usually measured in *magnitudes*. Magnitudes can be a counterintuive measure of brightness when first encountered, for two reasons: (1) they are *logarithmic*, and (2) they are defined so that *brighter objects have smaller magnitudes*. Specifically, the magnitude scale is designed in such a way that if object 1 is 100 times brighter than object 2, and if object 2 has a magnitude of $m_2$, then the magnitude of object 1 is exactly $m_1 = m_2 - 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that said, luckily, the details of all this need not concern us here. This is because we will work in magnitude units throughout, so we never have to convert back and forth between magnitudes and other measures of brightness. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Just for reference: Strictly speaking, one needs to specify what wavelength range one is talking about when one refers to a magnitude. All of the data in this Assignment are for the visual (V) band.]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parallax\n",
    "\n",
    "The parallax of a star is its angular displacement relative to distant background stars over the course of a year (see e.g. \n",
    "<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax\">here</a>). The closer the star is to Earth, the larger its parallax. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, there is a simple relationship between the parallax of a star ($p_{mas}$, measured in milli-arcseconds) and its distance from Earth ($d_{pc}$, measured in *parsecs*):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{pc} = 1000/p_{mas}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion from parsecs to meters is $1 {\\rm \\,pc} = 3.086 \\times 10^{16} {\\rm \\,m}$. For reference, $1$ pc $\\simeq 3.3$ light years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Apparent vs absolute magnitudes; distance modulus; extinction\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we observe two identical objects that are located at two different distances from us. Then obviously the one further away from us will appear to be fainter. This is no different than saying that the 100 Watt light bulb in my office seems a lot brighter to me than the same light bulb in another office across campus, which I can barely make out through my window. It is therefore important to distinguish between the *intrinsic* brightness of an object -- something that measures the fact that the light bulb is 100 Watts -- and the *apparent* brightness of an object -- which, for a given intrinsic brightness, depends only on the distance towards the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In astronomy, we use *absolute magnitudes* to talk about *intrinsic brightness*. And we use *apparent magnitude* to talk about *apparent brightness*. In order to distinguish between them, we denote an *absolute magnitude* by an *upper case* $M$, and *apparent magnitudes* by lower case $m$. The absolute magnitude of an object is formally defined as the apparent magnitude it would have if it were located at a distance of exactly 10 pc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the relationship between absolute and apparent magnitudes obviously has to involve the distance from the object. Specifically, the difference between apparent and absolute magnitudes is called \n",
    "the *distance modulus*, $\\mu$, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = m - M$$\n",
    " \n",
    "And since magnitudes are logarithmic units, this difference (i.e. the distance modulus) scales with the logarithm of the distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one other factor we need to account for. When we observe an object in the Milky Way or in a distant galaxy, there is often also a substantial amount of gas and dust between us and the object. This gas and dust can obscure our view of the object, i.e. it can make the object appear *dimmer* than it would if this stuff weren't in the way. We can quantify this by defining the *extinction*, $A$, as the dimming effect of the intervening \"stuff\", measured in units of magnitudes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these things together, we get the following relationship between apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, distance and extinction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = m - M = 5 \\log{d_{pc}} - 5 + A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Period-luminosity relation\n",
    "\n",
    "The intrinsic brightness of a pulsating Cepheid variable star depends on the period of its pulsation. The physics of this is interesting, but needn't concern us here. The dependence of brightness on period is usually modelled via a simple linear relationship between the absolute magnitude and the logarithm of the pulsation period:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M = \\alpha \\log{P} + \\beta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the so-called \"period-luminosity relation\". \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in the file \"MW_Cepheids.dat\", together with the information provided above, is sufficient to estimate the parameters defining period luminosity relation (and their uncertainties). Specifically, your goal is to obtain optimal estimates (and errors) for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. You should also address the correlation or lack thereof between $\\alpha$s and $\\beta$s.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to achieve this, you will first need to estimate the absolute magnitudes for all Cepheids in the sample (using their apparent magnitudes, the parallaxes and the extinction estimates). The data includes the pulsation periods, so you can then fit the absolute magnitudes, using the period-luminosity relations described above as your model. This will give you the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints and tips\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few hints and tips you may want to think about as you do this (and address in your write-up). \n",
    "\n",
    "* where errors are provided, you may assume that they are Gaussian\n",
    "\n",
    "* where errors are *not* provided (e.g. on apparent magnitudes and periods), it usually means that the relevant quantities is very precisely known, so the error on it can be ignored\n",
    "\n",
    "* in order to estimate errors on the absolute magnitudes, you will need to propagate the errors on the distance and extinction somehow; make sure to think about this error propagation carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "* since the simple, linear period-luminosity relation is really just an approximation to fairly complex underlying physics, it is possible that there may be extra scatter  around the relationship (in excess of that expected from the observational errors); if this happens -- i.e. if one or both of your fits to the period-luminosity relation are not formally acceptable (in terms of its $\\chi^2$), you should still \"accept\" the relationship but explicitly allow for this extra \"intrinsic dispersion\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* If your best-fit $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ values are correlated, you might want to consider using the strategy discussed in one of our final lessons."

    "3. The report (Weight: 30%)\n",
    "    * does the write-up clearly and concisely explain what has been done?\n",
    "    * does it explain and justify any approximations that were made?\n",
    "    * does it explain and justify any non-standard approaches that were used?\n",

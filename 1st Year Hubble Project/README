This Python code analyzes Cepheid variable star data 
to derive distances and absolute magnitudes, fitting 
a Period-Luminosity relation using the Levenberg-Marquardt 
optimization method to minimize chi-squared values.
It refines model parameters by iteratively shifting 
the period data to reduce correlation between the model's 
slope and intercept. The code also processes data from multiple 
galaxies, calculating their distances based on Cepheid stars and 
adjusting for outliers. It then uses the derived distances and 
galaxy recession velocities to estimate the Hubble constant (H0) 
and the age of the universe, incorporating error propagation and 
statistical analysis. The results, along with visualizations, help 
estimate cosmological parameters like the expansion rate of the universe 
and its age.
